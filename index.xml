This song feels like such an intimate song. The creator makes you feel like a person watching through her webcam and gives a peek into her lifestyle. The smoothness and the subtleness of her voice is simply amazing.
Daniela Andrade - Genesis
It all started with this song. I stumbled upon her music through this song which played at an event.</description></item><item><title>Music Week - 06 - 2020</title><link>https://abhimanyubabbar.github.io/posts/music-week-06-2020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2020 12:07:37 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://abhimanyubabbar.github.io/posts/music-week-06-2020/</guid><description>For this week, I found new sound nuggets which I would like to share with you all
Divine - Sher Aaya Sher
I got introduced to GULLY BOY songs pretty late but man o man they are a force of nature. I specially like this song and the rap.
Gryffin - Nobody Compares to You
This is such a goody good song. I have been following Gryffin for sometime now and this song I feel has the right melody, bass and drums.</description></item><item><title>Music Week - 04 - 2020</title><link>https://abhimanyubabbar.github.io/posts/music-week-04-2020/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 12:07:37 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://abhimanyubabbar.github.io/posts/music-week-04-2020/</guid><description>While working on my side projects and at work, below songs are the ones I have been listening to on a regular basis. Hopefully, you find a gem or two in here:
Bishop Briggs - River
It's an uplifting track I think. I like how the song is shot.
Faime - Rain
This one is a beauty here. Such a nice melodic tune, makes you wanna just sit and relax.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://abhimanyubabbar.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 13:36:37 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://abhimanyubabbar.github.io/about/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
